1. For Loop
This python program is to demonstrate for loop
We will use range function in this loop function, this will create a range object that represents numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive of 1, exclusive of 51)
Initiate the variable sum1  = 0
Then we use i, which basically means iteration
Each time the loop runs, i takes the next value from the num range (i.e., 1, then 2, then 3, ..., up to 50).
Inside the loop, this adds the current value of i to sum1.
It's equivalent to sum1 = sum1 + i.
Finallt print the output

2. ifelse loop
Enter a number.
input() is a function which will get the as a string, so we will use int() funciton to convert into integer
We will use modulus operator %, which gives the remainder after division.
output will be 
0 if a is even (because even numbers divide by 2 without a remainder),
1 if a is odd (because there's a remainder of 1 when divided by 2).
The result is stored in the variable b.
